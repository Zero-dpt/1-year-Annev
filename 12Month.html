    <h2>
        My Love, Happy 1st Anniversary

        I can’t believe it’s been a whole year since we started this journey together. Ang bilis ng panahon, parang
        kahapon lang na nagkakilala tayo, naguusap pa lang, getting to know each other… and now look at us—one year
        stronger, one year closer, one year deeper in love.

        This past year has been filled with so many memories—some happy, some challenging—but all of them brought us
        closer together. Kahit may mga tampuhan, misunderstanding, or times na parang ang hirap na, we still chose to
        stay. And for that, thank you. Thank you for choosing me every single day. Thank you for loving me even when I’m
        hard to love. Thank you for supporting me sa mga panahong pagod ako, down ako, stress ako. You’ve always been my
        peace, my safe place, my light.

        There were times when I felt like I didn’t deserve someone like you, but you’ve always reminded me na I am worth
        loving. Kahit LDR tayo, you’ve made me feel loved and cared for in every way possible. Yung mga “wabyou,”
        “mwamwa,” late-night chats, unexpected visits, your efforts to come see me despite the distance—all of it, I
        will treasure forever. I can proudly say na ikaw yung unang taong pinakilala ko sa pamilya ko not just because I
        love you, but because I see a future with you.

        I’m sorry for the moments when I fell short—when I didn’t listen, when I made mistakes, when I failed to update
        you or made you feel less than you deserve. I never meant to hurt you. Sometimes I mess up, but please know I’m
        learning, and I’m trying every day to be better for you. Because you’re worth it. You’ve always been worth it.

        Ang dami ko natutunan dahil sayo—patience, understanding, forgiveness, and what real love looks like. You’ve
        given me so many firsts, so many memories, so many reasons to smile and keep going. You are the person I want to
        build my dreams with. You’re my girlfriend, my best friend, my future wife.

        Kahit ilang beses ko na sinabi to sayo, it will never be enough—I love you so, so much. No words can describe
        how deeply I feel for you. No distance can ever lessen what we have. One day, we won’t have to say goodnight
        through the phone. One day, we’ll come home to the same house. One day, we’ll wake up next to each other, and
        this distance will just be a memory.

        We made it to one year, love. And this is just the beginning.

        Happy 1st Anniversary, my love. Here’s to all the laughs, the tears, the kisses, the growth—and everything in
        between. Thank you for being mine.

        Forever and always,
        Your one and only,
        Wabyoumuchmuch. Mwamwamwa.
