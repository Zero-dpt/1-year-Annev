        My baby,
        Happy 5th monthsary!
        Can you believe it’s already been five months? Time feels like it moves so fast, yet every moment with you is
        one I want to hold onto forever. Even with the distance between us, you make me feel so loved, valued, and cared
        for. I never thought I could feel this connected to someone who isn’t physically by my side, but you’ve shown me
        what true love really means.
        These five months have been a journey of growth and understanding. We’ve faced challenges, celebrated
        milestones, and built a foundation of trust that I know will carry us forward. Your patience, your kindness, and
        the way you make me feel special every single day have shown me just how lucky I am to have you in my life.
        Sometimes, I find myself wishing we could erase the miles between us and close the gap that keeps us apart. I
        dream of the day I can finally hold you in my arms, feel your warmth, and look into your eyes without a screen
        between us. But until that day comes, I want you to know that I’m here, always. My heart is with you, no matter
        how far away we may be.
        You’ve become my light in dark moments and my greatest source of joy. I admire your strength, your resilience,
        and the way you pour love into everything you do. You’ve taught me so much about what it means to be patient and
        to treasure every moment, no matter how small.
        Thank you for being my partner, my best friend, and my greatest love. Thank you for believing in us and for
        giving me a love that makes me feel whole. These five months are just the beginning of a lifetime I want to
        spend with you.
        So here’s to us—our love, our resilience, and the beautiful future I know we’re building together. I’ll wait as
        long as it takes, because you’re worth it.
        I love you more than words could ever express. Happy 5th monthsary, my baby.
